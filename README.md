# Kotlin Coroutines Examples

This is the example code for the Medium post [Playing with Kotlin in Android: coroutines and how to get rid of the callback hell](https://medium.com/@andrea.bresolin/playing-with-kotlin-in-android-coroutines-and-how-to-get-rid-of-the-callback-hell-a96e817c108b).

This app is provided as a proof of concept of some ideas about [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html) in Android.

## Note

To show examples of remote REST service calls, Iâ€™ve used the weather API at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and my app ID is bundled in the code to make it easier for you to test it immediately, but mine is a free account, so make sure you create your own account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace **WEATHER_API_APP_ID** inside **build.gradle** with your own ID to avoid blocking the account because of too many requests to the API.
